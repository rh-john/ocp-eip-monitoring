# Combined NetworkPolicy for EIP monitor supporting both COO and UWM
# This policy is always applied by deploy-monitoring.sh and works for both
# single-stack (COO-only or UWM-only) and dual-stack deployments.
# The individual NetworkPolicies (networkpolicy-coo.yaml and networkpolicy-uwm.yaml)
# are deprecated and should not be used.
