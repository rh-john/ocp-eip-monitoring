# Perses Instance for COO
# NOTE: This file is kept for reference, but the actual Perses instance
# for console integration is created automatically by UIPlugin in openshift-operators
# namespace when spec.monitoring.perses.enabled: true
#
# PersesDashboards and PersesDatasources should be deployed in openshift-operators
# namespace to be visible in the OpenShift web console.
#
# This file can be used if you need a separate Perses instance for non-console use.

  # - resource limits
  # - other deployment configurations
  # For now, using defaults which should work for most cases
